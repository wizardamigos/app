In the future more and more jobs will demand the knowledge of programming - many say it will become the literacy of the future, like reading and writing today - so in order to not be left behind and to have nice opportunities in your future, it is really important to add this skill to your existing skill set.

There are many languages you can learn, but in the past years, JavaScript is becoming the English of programming languages. With it, you can build web pages, mobile apps, desktop apps, control drones, do virtual reality, data analysis and much more. It is very universal and it is growing in popularity.

This program is suitable for absolute beginners.

### 1. You start with setting up your environment
* `Gmail`, `Chrome`, **`Bookmarks`**, `Keyboard Typing`, `Github Profile`
* **`Gists`**, using `Wikipedia/Google Translate/...`, create `Screencasts`

### 2. Next you learn the alphabet of JavaScript (syntax, grammar,...)
Because this is pure theory that needs repetition to be memorized, we figured out, the best way is to use CodeCombat, a game that helps you learn the syntax without making it too dry and boring. This way you repeat things and in between you will find videos with theory summaries of what you have learned so far, so keep watching videos.

### 3. Then you build your first profile page with a portfolio section
You build your first portfolio web page and learn how to
* retrieve data from a database
* do simple animations

### 4. Then we continue with building your first web app (a quiz)
This is your first portfolio item and we recommend you play and customize it a bit and don't just copy the tutorial instructions. We explain you all the details about how to do that.

### 5. Finally we learn how to transform this quiz into a mobile app.
So you can upload it to the android play store or apple store for other users to download.

After that more tutorials come, but this is the first batch. So, join us and get started. For all the questions, you have the `chat` and the community is more than happy to help you with answers.
