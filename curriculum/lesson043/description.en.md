And yet more practicing :-)
We recommend to maybe even save some often used snippets of code in a `gist` that you add to your `bookmarks` so that you can copy/paste it in later lessons instead of writing it again and again and again.

But then remember, writing code again and again is repetition that helps you remember while you still don't remember properly how to write code.
