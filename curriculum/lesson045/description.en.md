Like with reading and writing, people can write about all kinds of stuff.
Playing code combat is similar to programming drones.
You write the logic to navigate your character through the levels.

In this level, a new feature is introduced.
When you **run** your code, you can interact with your little virtual robot warrior by planting **flags** with your mouse and if you wrote the code correctly, your little robot will respond to those events based on the code you wrote.
