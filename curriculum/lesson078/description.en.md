Let speed things up. This time we do many levels in a row.
It will be very hard.
If you don't manage, don't feel shy to check our solution.
We also sometimes did not find a way to solve a certain level and sometimes you can just skip it.
If you manage to solve `The Trials` you will probably practice and learn a lot :-)
