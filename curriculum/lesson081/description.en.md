A `function` is a re-usable code snippet which also allows customization.

In this world we learn how to define `functions`, use `functions`, define `parameter` for those functions and later `call` a function and pass it `arguments`. Passing `arguments` to a `function call` customizes the execution of your code snippet.

You can call a defined function many times and each time pass different arguments to it to customize your code snippet in different ways.
