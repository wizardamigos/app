**In this level we introduce `functions`**

Feel free to re-write some of your `code snippets` you might have saved as `gists` as `functions`, so you can copy and paste them from your `bookmarked gists` to solve future levels.

If you take some time to really improve the functions you define a lot and think how you want to customize them, then re-using them in the future becomes more easy :-)
