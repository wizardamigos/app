Defining a new `function` is like defining a new *verb*. You describe the meaning or logic behind the new *verb* with more basic vocabulary and then you can use your new `function` when defining even more "high levle" *verbs*. So the goal is to slowly build your custom little language that should make it easy to describe the solution for a problem at hand.

In this level you can write some little "helper functions" to draw interesting flowers, like e.g. `drawCircle()` or `drawLines()` and so on...
