Practice some more and think hard about which `functions` that you defined in your `gists` can be re-used.

One main goal is, that through practice, you get good in writing `functions` *(=verbs)*, which can be re-used in many situations. So you slowly build yourself a useful vocabulary that with which you can easily solve problems you encounter :-)
