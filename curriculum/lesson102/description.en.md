Welcome to Section 2 where you will learn how to build your portfolio page. We hope you will enjoy working on your first web project with WizardAmigos app. To learn more about **HTML and CSS** we recommend you check our [learning resources](https://github.com/wizardamigosinstitute/service/blob/master/skillTree.md). After you finish it, come back and continue building your portofilo page and later also a quiz app and your iOS app.

IMPORTANT: In the videos we use RequireBin, but were commend you to try out [CodePen - here is how you set it up](https://github.com/wizardamigosinstitute/service/blob/master/curriculum/newLessons/codepen.md).

The full code for this project you can find in [this repository](https://github.com/esova-ana/portfolio).
